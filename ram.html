   <div class="boxl"><h4>RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that stores data temporarily for the computer's CPU to access quickly. Unlike storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs), RAM does not permanently store data but is instead used as a fast, temporary storage space that the CPU can access quickly when it needs to perform calculations or execute programs.
    <br> When a program is opened, its data and instructions are loaded from storage devices into RAM, allowing the CPU to access them quickly as it executes the program. The more RAM a computer has, the more programs it can run simultaneously without slowing down. However, having more RAM than needed does not necessarily make a computer faster, and there is usually a point of diminishing returns where adding more RAM will not provide significant benefits.
</h4></div>
   <div class="boxr"><h4>RAM is measured in units of bytes, with common amounts ranging from 4GB to 32GB or more in modern computers. The speed of RAM is measured in MHz (megahertz) and is an important factor in determining how quickly data can be accessed and processed. Faster RAM speeds can improve overall system performance, particularly in memory-intensive applications like gaming or video editing.
    <br> RAM is typically installed in slots on the computer's motherboard and can be easily upgraded or replaced. However, different types of RAM are not interchangeable, and it's important to ensure that any new RAM is compatible with the computer's motherboard before making an upgrade.
