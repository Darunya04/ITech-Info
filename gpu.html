   <div class="boxl"><h4>GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor designed to handle the complex calculations required for rendering graphics and images. While CPUs are general-purpose processors that can handle a wide range of tasks, GPUs are specifically optimized for parallel processing and performing the repetitive calculations required for rendering graphics. 
    <br> GPUs are widely used in video games, scientific simulations, and other applications that require complex graphical processing. They can also be used for tasks like machine learning and data analysis, where the ability to perform many calculations in parallel is important.
    <br> Modern GPUs typically have thousands of processing cores and are capable of performing trillions of calculations per second. They are designed to work in conjunction with CPUs, offloading the graphics processing tasks to free up CPU resources for other tasks.
</h4></div>
   <div class="boxr"><h4>The performance of a GPU is often measured in terms of its memory bandwidth, clock speed, and number of processing cores. High-end models can be very expensive, but they offer significantly improved performance over lower-end models and are essential for demanding graphical applications.
    <br> GPUs are typically installed in a computer as a separate card that plugs into a PCIe slot on the motherboard. They require cooling to prevent overheating during use, and high-end models may require additional power connectors from the power supply.
