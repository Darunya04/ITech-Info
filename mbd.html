   <div class="boxl"><h4>A motherboard, also known as a mainboard or system board, is the central printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer that connects and controls all the major components of the system. It provides a way for these components to communicate with each other and allows the computer to function as a cohesive whole.
    <br> The motherboard typically includes sockets or slots for the CPU, RAM, graphics card, storage devices, and other peripherals like network adapters or sound cards. It also includes a BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) chip that provides low-level system control and boot-up functions.
</h4></div>
   <div class="boxr"><h4>Modern motherboards come in a variety of form factors, which determine their physical size and the components they can accommodate. The most common form factor for desktop computers is ATX (Advanced Technology Extended), but smaller form factors like Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX are also available for compact or specialized systems.
    <br> Motherboards may include various features like built-in Wi-Fi, multiple Ethernet ports, USB and audio connectors, and overclocking capabilities. Some motherboards are also designed for specific types of use, such as gaming or content creation. <br>
    Upgrading or replacing a motherboard can be a complex process that requires technical expertise, as it involves disassembling and reassembling many components of the computer. It may also require reinstalling the operating system and other software.
