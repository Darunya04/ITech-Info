   <div class="boxl"><h1>AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, is a multinational semiconductor company that specializes in designing and manufacturing computer processors, graphics cards, and other related technologies. Founded in 1969, AMD has long been a major player in the computer hardware industry, competing primarily with rival company Intel in the CPU market and with Nvidia in the GPU market.
    <br>AMD has also been a pioneer in the development of heterogeneous computing, which involves using multiple types of processors in a single system. This approach can improve system performance by allowing different processors to handle different types of tasks.
   </h1></div>
   <div class="boxr"><h1>AMD is known for its line of Ryzen processors, which are highly regarded for their strong performance and value proposition. Ryzen processors use the Zen architecture, which has been lauded for its efficient and effective use of processing power. Additionally, AMD offers a range of Radeon graphics cards, which compete with Nvidia's offerings in the GPU market.
    <br> One of AMD's notable achievements was the introduction of the x86-64 architecture, which is now used in most modern desktop and laptop CPUs. This architecture allows processors to support 64-bit operating systems and applications, which can handle more memory and perform more complex tasks than 32-bit systems. <br> Overall, AMD has gained a reputation for offering competitive alternatives to Intel and Nvidia in the CPU and GPU markets, respectively. Its products are widely used in gaming, content creation, and other demanding applications.
